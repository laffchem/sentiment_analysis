# Sentiment Analyzer

## Installation

Create a virtual environment

Source into said environment via terminal
`source venv/bin/activate` or whatever...

Then install requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Run

Download and unzip that file Sam posted into the teams chat.

Once unzipped, run the converter.py file by pressing the play button while it is open.

You can now get rid of all the unzipped files.

You should now see a "data" directory with a bunch of huge .txt files in it. I didn't upload it for copyright issues and stuff.

Then run main.py file and you'll see a sentiment_table.csv get created.
