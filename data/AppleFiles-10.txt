On March 21, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed an antitrust complaint against Apple Inc. for anticompetitive behavior. The DoJ cited five practices that "suppress technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones:" suppressing super apps and cloud streaming games, degrading the quality of third-party messaging apps, suppressing key functions of third party smartwatches, and denying access to third-party digital wallets.
The DoJ claims these practices allow Apple to maintain a monopoly over the smartphone industry. The complaint elaborates how Apple's prevention of third-party wallet apps allows them to "[retain] full control both over the consumer and also over the stream of income generated by forcing users to use only Apple-authorized products in the digital wallet." But wait, how is someone's banking related to their smartphone usage?
Suppose I have a credit card with a bank that uses a massive service such as Mastercard or Visa. No problem, both companies are authorized by Apple to be used in the Apple Wallet. I soon discovered a local credit union that offers a better rate on a credit card and it would benefit me to switch and create an account with this organization. Unfortunately, I cannot add this service to my Apple Wallet because it is unauthorized. Like many Americans, I use a digital wallet for my payments. I cannot switch from my current provider to the smaller, better option for me because of Apple's control of what banking services I can use through their wallet. My experience as a banking consumer is harmed because of Apple's control over mobile payments on their phones.
This upsets me because I want to switch to my local credit union and use my mobile phone to pay, so I look at iPhone competitors. I again run into problems. Not all of my cards can transfer from my Apple Wallet, which includes bank cards, state-issued IDs, public transit systems, membership cards, keys, concert tickets, and more. To switch to a non-iPhone could require me to close several accounts I use on a regular basis, potentially even hurting my credit score which in turn harms my opening of a new account with my local credit union: my original goal. It could also risk losing the key scan into my apartment, concert tickets for which I've paid hundreds of dollars, and my metro card which allows me to go to work. Apple is clear they want to prevent transferability between their products and others. My life is financially locked into me being an Apple customer. I have no real choice as a consumer. I must stay with Apple. I am prevented from pursuing a beneficial banking option simply because I am locked into using an iPhone.
It is the role of the DoJ to protect consumers from this issue. In fact, Apple's rebound from bankruptcy is only possible due to the ruling in United States v. Microsoft, which forced Microsoft to allow third-party software such as iTunes onto their software. In recent years, Apple has come under fire for monopolistic practices both domestically in Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple, Inc., and abroad receiving a 1.8 Billion Euro fine from the European Commission. This complaint by the DoJ continues the growing response to the growth of the Technology Industry from government bodies. As the second-largest traded public company, this case will have broad consequences for the technology industry and the market as a whole.

MUMBAI, India, July 5 -- Intellectual Property India has published a patent application (202317026923 A) filed by Apple Inc., Cupertino, U.S.A., on April 11, 2023, for 'blind retransmission schemes.'
Inventor(s) include Yao, Chunhai; Ye, Chunxuan; Zhang, Dawei; Hu, Haijing; Sun, Haitong; He, Hong; Niu, Huaning; Oteri, Oghenekome; Vangala, Sarma V.; Ye, Sigen; Zeng, Wei; Yang, Weidong; Zhang, Yushu; and Ji, Zhu. The application for the patent was published on July 5, under issue no. 27/2024. According to the abstract released by the Intellectual Property India: "Systems, methods, and circuitries are provided for supporting blind retransmission. In one example, a method includes processing control information that indicates resources for communication of a physical downlink shared channel or a physical uplink shared channel (PDSCH/PUSCH) transmission and timing information for a retransmission of the PDSCH/PUSCH. The method includes configuring operation to: receive the PDSCH/PUSCH transmission based on the resources; and determine that a subsequent PDSCH/PUSCH received at a subsequent time corresponds to the retransmission of the PDSCH/PUSCH when the subsequent time coincides with the indicated timing information for the retransmission and, in response combine the PDSCH/PUSCH with the retransmission in a HARQ buffer for decoding purposes." The patent application was internationally filed on Oct. 23, 2020, under International application No.PCT/CN2020/123243.

According to the abstract released by the Intellectual Property India: "Techniques to reduce signal interference between wired signals communicated within an electronic device and wireless signals transmitted to or received from antennas of the electronic device are disclosed. The electronic device includes an interposer with an inner fence and an outer fence having offset gaps to prevent a pathway otherwise formed by overlapping tabs, where the pathway allows noise leakage from the wired signals. In some embodiments, the electronic device (e.g., in a main logic board package) includes a ground fencing of ground vias to prevent the noise leakage from harmonics associated with signal vias communicating the wired signals. The spacing between the ground vias is based on frequencies of signals that the ground vias are intended to block."

MUMBAI, India, July 19 -- Intellectual Property India has published a patent application (202314029547 A) filed by Apple Inc., Cupertino, U.S.A., on April 24, 2023, for 'thermal module for a circuit board.'
Inventor(s) include Edmonds, Trevor J; Nigen, Jay S; Kosoglow, Richard D; and Hopkinson, Ron A. The application for the patent was published on July 19, under issue no. 29/2024. According to the abstract released by the Intellectual Property India: "An assembly for heat-generating components includes a metal and a non-metal layer. To secure to a circuit board that carries a heat-generating component, a metal standoff is secured on a perimeter of the circuit board. Multiple protruding elements of the metal layer of the assembly secure within a respective opening of the standoff. The assembly secures, through metal-to-metal contact, to the standoff by multiple mechanical couplings. The assembly not only covers the circuit board, but also extends laterally beyond the circuit board (and the circuit board components). As a result, the assembly receives thermal energy from a heat-generating component(s) on the circuit board and allows the thermal energy to flow through assembly from one portion of the assembly covering the heat-generating component(s) to the lateral portion of the assembly that does not cover the heat-generating component(s)."
