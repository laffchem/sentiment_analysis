Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja
Oil giant Chevron Corp has beaten estimates for first-quarter profit as higher production volumes in the US helped offset a hit from weak natural gas prices and fuel margins.
The second largest US oil producer posted a profit of $5.5 billion in the quarter ended on March 31, down from $6.57 billion, or $3.46 per share from a year ago. Results beat consensus by 2 per cent as recent acquisitions bolstered oil and gas volumes.
Chevron said results were sustained by higher production brought by the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc and sustained strong execution in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basins.
Chevron said first quarter oil and gas production jumped 12 per cent, to 3.34 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).
Earnings from pumping oil and gas were $5.24 billion, up from $5.16 billion in the same period a year ago. But profits from producing petrol and chemicals fell sharply, to $783 million from $1.8 billion a year ago. Refining suffered from weaker margins and higher operating expenses, the company said.
It reported adjusted per share profit of $2.93 for the first quarter, beating analysts' consensus estimate of $2.87.
Also, Exxon Mobil missed analysts' estimates with a 28 per cent year-on-year drop in first quarter profits as weaker refining margins and lower natural gas prices offset volume gains.
Exxon, which is in the process of closing a $60 billion deal for top shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources, posted lower first-quarter earnings of $8.22 billion, down from an $11.43 billion net profit a year ago.
Earnings from oil and gas production fell 14 per cent on lower natural gas prices and refining tumbled 67 per cent on weaker fuel margins, mark-to-market derivatives, and higher maintenance costs. Its chemicals business, however, was a standout, with earnings more than doubling on lower input costs and higher margins, the company said.

Venezuela inks 20-year gas deal with BP and Trinidad amid push for energy exports

Venezuela has signed a 20-year agreement with BP Plc and Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company (NGC) for natural gas production and exploration, Venezuelan Oil Minister Pedro Tellechea announced on July 24, as reported by Bloomberg.  
Earlier this year, the two companies were granted a two-year licence from the US Treasury Department to negotiate and develop the Cocuina-Manakin gas fields with Caracas.  
The deal, which focuses on the Cocuina gas field off Venezuela's coast, is expected to produce approximately 400mn cubic feet (11.3mn cubic metres) of gas per day. According to the Venezuelan oil ministry, 25% of the production will supply Trinidad's petrochemical sector, with the remainder allocated to the island's LNG export industry.  
This agreement marks a significant step in Venezuela's ambition to become a major natural gas exporter and comes as international oil companies gradually increase their presence in the country, which hosts the world's largest proven oil reserves, following years of US sanctions that had limited foreign investment.  
After the Biden administration reimposed sanctions on Caracas in April following the expiration of a six-month waiver, Spain's Repsol SA obtained an ad-hoc licence to continue operations in Venezuela, while Chevron Corp resumed oil drilling and Indian refiner Reliance Industries Ltd was recently given the green light to restart Venezuelan oil imports.  
The deal was announced a few days before Venezuela's high-stakes presidential election scheduled for July 28, where President Nicolas Maduro is seeking a third term amid historically low popularity ratings.  
Previous studies indicate that Venezuela's Manakin and Cocuina fields contain an estimated one trillion cubic feet (28.3bn cubic metres) of gas reserves.

After 17 years, Venezuela recorded a monthly deflation of 05% in February.

       Caracas - Venezuela recorded a monthly deflation of 0.5% in February, according to estimates of the Financial Observatory. The annual inflation rate reached 85%, according to a statement published on its website.
The phenomenon "had not been seen for many years," the group said. Food prices, which have the greatest weight in the index, fell 3.1% last month due to retail discounts.
The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) has yet to release February inflation data.
Another key factor has been the gradual stabilization of the exchange rate, achieved by President Nicolas Maduro's government by increasing dollar sales in the official market, while drastically reducing spending in local currency, which reduces the need to print money.
Dollar sales have nearly doubled in the country thanks to the additional supply of dollars from Chevron Corp (CVX), now one of the main suppliers in the local exchange market after a U.S. license allowed it to expand its operations in Venezuela.
"The central bank managed to anchor expectations and people expect the exchange rate to remain under control," said Angel Alvarado, senior researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and founder of the Financial Observatory.

Corporate greed, inequality

Our economic inequality is being fueled by two disastrous decisions. One is the 1982 SEC ruling to lessen Wall Street rules and regulations, including one on stock buybacks. Between 2015 and 2017 more than half of the total profits earned by PepsiCo, Kraft Heinz, Archer Daniels Midland and Tyson Foods were spent on stock buybacks. Fifty-four percent of profits from the S&P 500 companies went toward stock buybacks. From 2008 to 2018, American restaurant chains, including Starbucks, McDonald's and Domino's Pizza, spent $5,000,000,000,000 on stock buybacks. 
The second disastrous decision was the 2017 massive corporate tax cut. With their added profits, corporations have been gouging on stock buybacks. Ten major drug companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck, in one year, spent $75,000,000,000 on stock buybacks. In 2023, Chevron Corp. spent $14,700,000,000, and Exxon Mobil spent $17,800,000,000 on stock buybacks. Four large conglomerates, with a monopoly of 85% of the market, Tyson, JBS, Marfrig and Seaboard, increased their gross profits by 120% since before the pandemic, and spent $4,000,000,000 in stock buybacks. 
Instead of reducing prices to help the struggling consumer, corporations enriched management and stockholders with stock buybacks at the expense of the average American. Some of the excess profits, instead of going to the already wealthy, could have increased the salaries of the workers who make the profits possible in the first place.

Leviathan partners to take FID on Phase 1B following ministry approval
Middle East Oil & Gas Monitor

The partners in Israel's Leviathan gas field are expected to take the decision to invest $400mn-500mn in the front-end engineering design (FEED) of the asset's Phase 1B expansion project.  
This decision follows the preliminary approval by Israel's Ministry of Energy to increase natural gas exports while also boosting domestic supply. The export volume could be raised by an additional 118bn cubic metres, potentially reaching up to 145 bcm upon meeting certain conditions.  
According to the field's majority shareholder NewMed Energy, this, alongside the government resolutions adopted on the issue, constitutes a basis for the promotion of Phase 1B of Leviathan.  
NewMed, formerly Delek Drilling, holds a stake of 45.3% and is partnered by operator Chevron Corp. (39.66%) and the local Ratio Oil Corp. (15%).  
Phase 1B aims to boost gas production and supply to 21bcm per year, catering both to domestic demand and providing the basis for an increase in exports.  
In a press release, NewMed CEO Yossi Abu said: "The Leviathan expansion is taking shape. The Leviathan reservoir is an energy hub containing a vast amount of resources, ensuring energy security for Israel, alongside exports to the regional market and, in the foreseeable future, also to the global market."  
Production at Leviathan began in December 2019, with gas going to the domestic Israeli market. The field now supplies gas to Jordan and Egypt as well, and plans are being drawn up to install a floating LNG (FLNG) vessel at the site with a capacity to produce 4.5mn tonnes (6.5 bcm) per year. Initial investment in the FLNG project is estimated to cost $100mn.  
In March 2023, a report by Texas-based Netherland Sewell and Associates Inc (NSAI) raised the value of the field to $12.5bn.
