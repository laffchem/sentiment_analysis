Highlight: The New York investment bank posted net earnings of $3.04bn , $8.62 per share, compared with $1.22bn in the same period a year earlier
Body


Goldman Sachs has reported a 150% surge in second quarter profits, thanks to a revival in dealmaking and underwriting that has breathed new life into investment banking after a couple of slow years. 
The New York-based investment bank announced net earnings of $3.04billion, or $8.62 per share, a significant increase from the $1.22billion recorded in the same period last year. This profit boost is partly due to Goldman Sachs accounting for some one-off items last year as it took charges for winding down its consumer banking business. 
However, nearly every facet of Goldman's operations saw revenue increases this quarter, reflecting a widespread resurgence in Wall Street activity in a healthy economy. Investment banking fees climbed by 21%, largely driven by a substantial rise in debt underwriting fees. 
Many firms are having to refinance their debts to cope with higher interest rates, leading to a boom in leveraged financing packages. Revenues in Goldman's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division were up 17% from a year earlier.
 Equities trading didn't perform quite as strongly as other market sectors, with Goldman reporting a 7% increase in net revenues in this division. Finally, the bank's asset-management division posted a 27% rise in revenues, boosted by increased fee income and the value of Goldman's own investments.
Shares in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. closed on Monday with an increase of $12.35, or 2.6%, at $492.23.

As Wall Street sets records, Goldman Sachs forecasts a flood of cash to buoy the stock market starting in July

A flood of cash from passive equity investments will drive a sharp rise in equity markets starting next month, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
"The start of the new quarter and new half-year is when a wall of cash will rush into the equity market," Scott Rubner, managing director and tactical specialist in Goldman Sachs' global markets division, wrote in a note Wednesday.
In addition, stock prices should benefit from strong seasonal trends and growing interest from smaller investors. "I see a resurgence of retail investors during the summer, who tend to show up in July," Rubner said.
Since 1928, the first 15 days of July have been the best two weeks of the year for equities, a rally that tends to lose steam after July 17, according to Rubner. The S&P 500 index has been positive for nine consecutive Julys, with an average return of 3.7%. The Nasdaq 100 index has an even better track record, with 16 consecutive Jules of gains, with an average return of 4.6%.
According to Rubner's calculations, approximately nine basis points of new capital enters the market each July. That would correspond to $26 billion based on $29 trillion in passive assets under management.
It is a difficult time to make short bets in the equity market "given the flows ahead and the random dynamics of the market," Rubner wrote.
The S&P 500 climbed back above 5,300 on Wednesday, its fourth consecutive session higher and nearing a new intraday high, buoyed by technology stocks. Nvidia Corp. broke another record and now has the second-highest weighting in the S&P 500 at 6.6%, surpassing Apple Inc. at 6.4% and trailing only Microsoft Corp. at 7%.

Fed needs to slay the inflation dragon': Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chairman John Waldron urged the Federal Reserve to make sure it doesn't divert its attention from fighting inflation.
"If you're the Fed, you have to slay the inflation dragon," Waldron, the Wall Street titan's No. 2, told an industry conference Thursday. The worst thing the Fed can do is declare victory before curbing the spiral of high prices that has gripped the economy, he said.
(More: ).
The Goldman banker recalled the perils of the 1970s, when persistent inflation forced Paul Volcker's Fed to raise interest rates by several percentage points at once to stabilize the U.S. economy.
Despite some signs of success with its monetary policy tools, the central bank cannot consider its mission accomplished because entrenched high rates have huge implications and remain the main topic in Goldman's conversations with clients, according to Waldron.
(You can read: ).
"Inflation is clearly moderating, but it remains stiff," he said. "We all agree it's still there in the system."
Waldron acknowledged that Fed policy has worked as designed, with a longer lag, due to the unique circumstances of the covid pandemic and the extraordinary monetary stimulus that followed.
(More: ).
The top manager after Goldman CEO David Solomon has in the past described the market backdrop as very complicated and one of the most difficult he has ever experienced.
.
Now, he said, the economy seems to be improving. "It's getting a little more benign and quite constructive," Waldron noted. "The soft landing is still the baseline scenario and the most likely scenario."

Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the witness stand in $600 million financial fraud case

Google parent Alphabet Inc Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai reportedly took the witness stand at the fraud trial of Ozy Media Inc co-founder Carlos Watson. According to a report in Bloomberg, Pichai testified that the search giant never intended to buy the startup for any amount of money. At the fraud trial, Pichai denied any plans by Google to acquire the startup. 
Carlos Watson, Ozy Media’s co-founder, faces allegations of misleading investors about the company’s financial health and falsely claiming Google’s interest in buying Ozy.The scandal surfaced when it was revealed that Ozy’s COO Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive during a call with Goldman Sachs, leading to the company’s downfall. Rao has admitted guilt and implicated the scheme as an attempt to deceive investors about Ozy’s profitability.What Sundar Pichai told the courtPichai told the jury in Brooklyn, New York, federal court that an acquisition of Ozy was never discussed but that Google did consider hiring Watson as head of its news programming. A $25 million investment in Ozy would have been part of that deal."Mr Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier," Pichai explained. But “did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.“No,” replied Pichai. He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.This counters Watson’s assertions used to entice a $20 million investment from another party after a deal with Goldman Sachs collapsed. Pichai mentioned only meeting Watson twice, once briefly at a conference and again during a job interview, which did not result in employment.What led to Ozy Media's collapseThe once high-flying media startup, Ozy Media collapsed after the New York Times reported in 2021 that Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao impersonated YouTube executive Alex Piper on a call with Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers.

Goldman Sachs' David Salomon predicts "zero" Fed rate cuts this year

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon said the economy's resilience thanks to higher government spending will keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates this year.
"I still don't see compelling data to say we're going to cut rates," he said from an event at Boston College, adding that he expects "zero" cuts. Investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure have also helped the economy become more resilient to Fed monetary tightening.
Fed minutes reveal growing consensus among officials on keeping interest rates higher for longer
However, the consumer is starting to feel the effect of higher prices, Solomon said. He pointed to recent results from McDonalds Corp. and AutoZone Inc. as evidence that consumers are starting to rein in spending.
"If we talk to CEOs of companies in the middle part of the U.S. economy, those companies have started to see changes in consumer behavior," he said. "Inflation is not just nominal. It's cumulative, and that's why everything is more expensive. The consumer, the average American, is starting to notice that."
That shift in consumer behavior raises the risk of a "real and palpable" slowdown compared to six months ago, he said. Solomon also cited geopolitical fragility, which he said is something people are going to have to live with for a long time.
Earlier this month, Solomon said the economy was "doing quite well," although he had warned in March that inflation was likely to be more pronounced than markets had anticipated.
In April, Goldman Sachs' team of economists said it expected only two cuts this year, the first in July and the second in November. This is a revision of its previous forecasts, and reflects the difficulty in predicting the Fed's path following the biggest surge in inflation in four decades.
Back to the office
Solomon also discussed the value of returning to pre-pandemic office habits, especially for younger employees who are still learning the business. About half of the company's employees are in their 20s and 30s, and "they come to the company with the explicit purpose of learning from other people," Solomon said. "That doesn't happen if people don't come together."
While many business leaders have taken public stands on social and political issues in recent years, Solomon said he doesn't see it as part of his job as CEO of Goldman. "This has become increasingly complicated," he said. "You can pick any issue and there will be a lot of Goldman Sachs people on both sides," he said.

Asante Kwaku Berko, the former managing director of Ghana's Tema Oil Refinery (TOR), has been extradited to the United States from the United Kingdom to face charges of orchestrating bribes to Ghanaian officials while employed at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, reports Bloomberg.  
Berko, a dual citizen of the US and Ghana, is charged with violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and money laundering, accused of bribing Ghanaian government officials to secure a power plant deal and laundering the payments through the US financial system.  
On July 15, Berko was extradited to the Eastern District of New York from the United Kingdom, where he was arrested on November 3, 2022, pursuant to an Interpol Diffusion Notice.   
Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Nicole M. Argentieri, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Head of the Criminal Division, and Christie M. Curtis, Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, announced the extradition.  
"As alleged, the defendant bribed Ghanaian government officials to secure a lucrative development contract relying on the U.S. banking system to execute his scheme," stated United States Attorney Peace. "My Office is committed to rooting out bribery and other criminal practices that create inequities in the playing field for business both here and abroad and exploit the U.S. banking system."  
Peace thanked the government of the United Kingdom, the U.K. National Centre Bureau for INTERPOL, the Embassy of the United States in London, the Department's Office of International Affairs, and the U.S. Marshals Service for their substantial assistance in securing the arrest and extradition of Berko.  
During the scheme, Berko and his co-conspirators allegedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including to Ghanaian officials, to ensure the Turkish energy company won its bid to build and operate the power plant.  
In April 2015, bribes were reportedly paid to five Ghanaian officials during an all-expenses-paid trip to Turkey to view equipment for the power plant, with each official receiving $5,000. After the power plant deal was ratified by the Ghanaian parliament in July 2015, Berko and his co-conspirators exchanged detailed emails regarding their bribe payments.

In a month when Nvidia Corp, briefly became the world's larg est company, hedge funds were "aggressively" selling tech stocks, according to analysis by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by soft ware and internet stocks.
Nvidia shares have been chop py after losing US$430 billion in market value late last week. And June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteor ic rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. accounted for more than half of the 15 per cent advance in the S&;P 500 this year.
The trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast
to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&;P 500 hit 33 per cent last week, the highest level in about 24 years.

Naira could rally below N1,000 Per U.S Dollar: Goldman Sachs
Naija 247 News

 According to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist, Nigeria's naira could maintain its momentum as the world's top-performing currency this month, but only if policymakers stay committed to their course.
In April alone, the naira has experienced a remarkable 12% rally against the dollar, building on its impressive 14% surge in March.
Factors such as capital inflows and interest rate hikes have contributed to its resurgence, helping to recover steep losses incurred due to two devaluations since June.
The recent upswing has propelled the naira to 1,230 per dollar at its latest official close, a significant improvement from its record low of 1,627 on March 8.Goldman economists, who previously forecasted the naira strengthening to 1,200 per dollar in 2024, now see potential for further advancement beyond that threshold.
This optimism follows a series of measures implemented by the central bank, including substantial interest rate hikes and initiatives to alleviate the scarcity of dollars in the local market.
Andrew Matheny of Goldman Sachs expressed confidence in the naira's trajectory, stating that the currency could potentially reach levels below 1,000 per dollar.
However, despite the positive outlook, Goldman maintains its 12-month forecast of 1,200 per dollar due to uncertainties surrounding the sustainability of the reform efforts.
The recent currency measures are part of broader reforms initiated by President Bola Tinubu to revive Nigeria's economy.
These reforms, which include the elimination of fuel subsidies, have led to a surge in inflation and exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis for Nigerians.
Despite the challenges, the naira has shown resilience, with the gap between the official and parallel market rates narrowing significantly. Governor Olayemi Cardoso, who assumed office in September, has been proactive in attracting foreign investment and clearing domestic dollar orders.
However, the central bank faces pressure to address inflation, which stood at a yearly rate of 31.7% in February.
Further rate hikes may be necessary, but they could hinder access to funds for businesses and impact competitiveness.
While the future of Nigeria's economic reforms remains uncertain, Goldman's Matheny emphasized the importance of the central bank maintaining credibility and stability.
As Nigeria navigates these challenges, the fate of its currency and economy hangs in the balance.
