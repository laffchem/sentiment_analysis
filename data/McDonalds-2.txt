Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon said the economy's resilience thanks to higher government spending will keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates this year.
"I still don't see compelling data to say we're going to cut rates," he said from an event at Boston College, adding that he expects "zero" cuts. Investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure have also helped the economy become more resilient to Fed monetary tightening.
Fed minutes reveal growing consensus among officials on keeping interest rates higher for longer
However, the consumer is starting to feel the effect of higher prices, Solomon said. He pointed to recent results from McDonalds Corp. and AutoZone Inc. as evidence that consumers are starting to rein in spending.
"If we talk to CEOs of companies in the middle part of the U.S. economy, those companies have started to see changes in consumer behavior," he said. "Inflation is not just nominal. It's cumulative, and that's why everything is more expensive. The consumer, the average American, is starting to notice that."
That shift in consumer behavior raises the risk of a "real and palpable" slowdown compared to six months ago, he said. Solomon also cited geopolitical fragility, which he said is something people are going to have to live with for a long time.
Earlier this month, Solomon said the economy was "doing quite well," although he had warned in March that inflation was likely to be more pronounced than markets had anticipated.
In April, Goldman Sachs' team of economists said it expected only two cuts this year, the first in July and the second in November. This is a revision of its previous forecasts, and reflects the difficulty in predicting the Fed's path following the biggest surge in inflation in four decades.
Back to the office
Solomon also discussed the value of returning to pre-pandemic office habits, especially for younger employees who are still learning the business. About half of the company's employees are in their 20s and 30s, and "they come to the company with the explicit purpose of learning from other people," Solomon said. "That doesn't happen if people don't come together."
While many business leaders have taken public stands on social and political issues in recent years, Solomon said he doesn't see it as part of his job as CEO of Goldman. "This has become increasingly complicated," he said. "You can pick any issue and there will be a lot of Goldman Sachs people on both sides," he said.

Posthaste: Canadians putting off plans to buy a home until the Bank of Canada cuts rates

Those expecting a spring rebound in Canada's housing market( https://financialpost.com/tag/housing-market/ ) might have to wait longer than they thought.
A survey by the Bank of Montreal revealed this week that 72 per cent of aspiring homeowners are waiting for the Bank of Canada( https://financialpost.com/tag/bank-of-canada/ ) to cut interest rates( https://financialpost.com/tag/interest-rates/ ) before buying.
Canadians opting to wait for rate relief are up 4 per cent from 2023 amid growing concerns about the cost of living, inflation and their financial situation, said BMO.
Among the almost 40 per cent planning to buy a home in the near future, only 13 per cent plan to buy in 2024 and 26 per cent plan to buy in 2025 or later, the report said.
Canadians are expecting a rate cut in the second half of this year, and that should bring some buyers back to market and firm up sales, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
"But rates have a long way to fall still before affordability is restored to recent norms," he said.
The Bank of Canada held( https://financialpost.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-holds-interest-rate-april-10-2024 ) its benchmark interest rate at five per cent this month, but signalled that a cut in June or July was possible. Forces at home and abroad, however, could delay that decision( https://financialpost.com/news/bank-of-canada-june-interest-rate-cut-not-slam-dunk ).
Though inflation has slowed in Canada in recent months, the central bank will be closely watching consumer price index data that comes out May 21 ahead of its June 5 meeting.
Stubbornly high inflation( https://financialpost.com/real-estate/us-inflation-threatens-canadian-mortgage-rates ) in the United States is also a concern. Predictions for a Federal Reserve rate cut( https://financialpost.com/tag/federal-reserve/ ) have been pushed back to December or later and a gap between policy rates would put pressure on the Canadian dollar( https://financialpost.com/tag/canadian-dollar/ ), running the risk of reigniting inflation.
Even if the Bank of Canada makes its first cut in June, policy makers have stressed( https://financialpost.com/news/economy/why-bank-of-canada-hold-interest-rates-april ) that any moves downward will be gradual.
March home sales( https://financialpost.com/tag/home-sales/ ) in Canada were flat and the MLS Home Price Index fell slightly, as not only buyers, but sellers as well, held back, said Robert Hogue, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada( https://financialpost.com/tag/royal-bank-of-canada/ ).
"We suspect a standoff between (inflexible) sellers and (budget-constrained) buyers is developing," said Hogue.
The BMO survey also revealed that while 62 per cent say owning a home is one of their biggest aspirations in life, more than half feel that dream is unattainable.
The majority of those surveyed believe they are making financial progress, but worries about unknown expenses, their overall financial situation and housing costs were causing financial anxiety.

Electric vehicles( https://financialpost.com/category/commodities/energy/electric-vehicles/ ) have been making headlines in Canada, with the announcement of Honda Motor Co( https://financialpost.com/tag/honda-motor-co/ )'s $15-billion EV and battery manufacturing facility last week. The complex, which will build on Honda's existing plant in Alliston, Ontario, should produce up to 240,000 vehicles when it opens in 2028.
But will the demand be there? Erik Johnson, senior economist at Bank of Montreal, shows in today's chart that EV and hybrid sales are picking up speed in Canada, despite a sluggish start to the year. In 2017, gas and diesel vehicles were nearly 98 per cent of sales; today they are 81 per cent.
"With Honda and Toyota recently announcing investments in the segment, the industry is signalling that affordable battery electric vehicles are likely shaping up to be a key arena of future competition," said Johnson.
