Did you lose money in your investment in Nike, Inc.?
Do you want to discuss your rights?
Bernstein Liebhard LLP, a nationally acclaimed investor rights law firm, reminds investors of the deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in a securities class action lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Class B common stock of Nike, Inc. (Nike or the Company) (NYSE: NKE) between March 19, 2021, and March 21, 2024, inclusive (the Class Period). The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company and certain of its senior officers (the Complaint).
If youpurchased or acquired Nike Class B common stock, and/or would like to discuss your legal rights and optionsplease visit Nike, Inc. Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit or contact Investor Relations Manager Peter Allocco at (212) 951-2030orpallocco@bernlieb.com. 
If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 19, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Your ability to share in any recovery doesnt require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you choose to take no action, you may remain an absent class member.
According to the Complaint, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that NIKEs direct-to-consumer strategy was unable to generate sustainable revenue growth and that NIKEs purported competitive advantages were unable to protect the Company from competitive pressures. Specifically, defendants materially misled investors about: (1) NIKEs ability to generate sustainable revenue growth under its direct-to-consumer strategy; (2) NIKEs purported competitive advantages to protect the Company from intense competitive pressures despite focusing on its direct-to-consumer strategy; and (3) as a result, defendants representations about NIKEs business, operations, and prospects. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages
Investors slowly learned the truth through a series of disclosures on June 27, 2022, September 29, 2022, December 21, 2023, and March 21, 2024. On March 21, 2024, NIKE reported declining revenues and Defendant Donahoe finally admitted that NIKE is not performing [to its] potential. When the truth entered the market, the share price of NIKE Class B common stock significantly declined.

As a result of its success litigating hundreds of lawsuits and class actions, the Firm has been named to The National Law Journals Plaintiffs Hot List thirteen times and listed in The Legal 500 for sixteen consecutive years.

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that (1) NIKEs direct-to-consumer strategy was unable to generate sustainable revenue growth, and (2) NIKEs purported competitive advantages were unable to protect the Company from intense competitive pressures after NIKE largely disengaged from many of its wholesale and retail partners to focus on the Companys direct-to-consumer strategy.

On June 27, 2022, Nike released its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results, disclosing that quarterly revenues had declined 1% year-over-year and quarterly wholesale revenues declined 7% year-over-year. On this news, Nikes stock price fell $7.72, or 7%, to close at $102.78 per share on June 28, 2022, thereby injuring investors.
Then, on September 29, 2022, Nike released its first quarter 2023 financial results, reporting a net income decline of 22% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share decline of 20% year-over-year. Additionally, the Company reported a significant reduction in gross margin driven by the disposal of excess inventory. On this news, Nikes stock price fell $12.21, or 12.8%, to close at $83.12 per share on September 30, 2022.
Then, on December 21, 2023, Nike released its second quarter 2024 financial results and stated that total retail sales across the marketplace fell short of [the Companys] expectations, and that Nikes digital platforms lost consumer traffic to competitors because of higher promotional activity across the marketplace. On this news, Nikes stock price fell $14.49, or 11.8%, to close at $108.04 per share on December 22, 2023.
Then, on March 21, 2024, Nike released its third quarter 2024 financial results, reporting a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment, a 3% year-over-year decline in Nike Digital revenue, and a mere 0.4% year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in Nike Direct. The Company also stated that Nike was prudently planning for revenue in the first half of the fiscal year [2025] to be down low single digits as the Company shift[s its] product portfolio toward newness and innovation. On this news, Nikes stock price fell $6.96, or 6.9%, to close at $93.86 per share on March 22, 2024, thereby injuring investors further.
The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Companys business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Nikes direct-to-consumer strategy was unable to generate sustainable revenue growth; (2) Nikes purported competitive advantages were unable to protect the Company from intense competitive pressures after NIKE largely disengaged from many of its wholesale and retail partners to focus on the Companys direct-to-consumer strategy; and (3) as a result, Defendants positive statements about the Companys business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.
