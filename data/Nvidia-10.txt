Meet man, earned Rs 7475287500000 in 5 months, runs firm 10 times bigger than Mukesh Ambani's Reliance, he is

Jensen Huang's net worth jumped to $91.3 billion, bumping him up three spots on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to become the 17th-richest person in the world.
Nvidia Corp. has reported Blockbuster profit and revenue skyrocketing as the company's dominance in chips for artificial intelligence applications fuelled extraordinary demand. Nvidia Corp, is an American company making AI chips. It is the third most valuable company in the world after Microsoft and Apple. Its market cap has reached $2.61 trillion. That means it is 10 times bigger than India's most valuable company Reliance Industries. The market cap of this company of Mukesh Ambani is $241.21 billion. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia is the highest-earning rich man this year. Jensen Huang owned a stake in his chipmaker worth roughly $3 billion five years ago. With the stock hitting a record high on Thursday, his holdings now total more than $90 billion.
Almost all of his money is invested in Nvidia stock, which surged 9.3% following a bullish sales estimate that reaffirmed the company's leadership in spending on artificial intelligence.
Nvidia late Wednesday reported first-quarter earnings that were above estimations, citing a third consecutive quarter of revenue increases of more than 200% due to the demand for artificial intelligence chips.
Huang gave investors a better-than-expected projection and said the company expects an endless market for its AI graphics processing units or GPUs. The business implied that its clients, particularly the large cloud computing firms, would receive a good return on their costly chip investment.
Huang owns more than 3.5% of Nvidia's outstanding shares or around 86.76 million shares. His investment gained over $7.7 billion in value as the stock surged over 9% on Thursday, closing at around $1,038 per share.
Nvidia's stock tripled in 2023 and has since more than doubled this year. In the last five years, they have increased roughly 28 times. In 2022, before the AI boom, Huang increased his holding in shares of the company.
Jen-Hsun Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963. At the age of five, his family relocated to Thailand. When he was nine years old, he and his brother were sent to live with their cousins in the United States. Jensen completed his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University in 1984, and master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1992.
In 1993, Huang (sixty-one) established the Silicon Valley business to produce GPUs for 3D gaming. For many years, Nvidia's primary business was gaming, but it has now expanded into other areas, such as cloud gaming subscriptions, the metaverse, and cryptocurrency mining processors.

Tech lifts U.S. stocks as FedEx surges in late hours

A rally in the worldâ€™s largest technology companies lifted stocks, with Nvidia Corp. climbing 7% after a $430 billion sell-off. Equities extended their June advance as the giant chipmaker led gains in the â€œMagnificent Sevenâ€ cohort of megacaps. 
In late trading, FedEx Corp. â€" a barometer of economic growth â€" jumped on a bullish forecast. Rivian Automotive Inc. also surged on news Volkswagen AG will invest $5 billion to form a joint venture with the electric-vehicle maker. Treasuries barely budged after a $69 billion two-year U.S. sale got the expected yield and good demand, kicking off this weekâ€™s trio of auctions. U.S. consumer confidence eased on a more muted outlook for business conditions, the job market and incomes. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said she sees a number of upside risks to the inflation outlook. Her colleague Lisa Cook said it will be appropriate to reduce rates â€œat some point,â€ adding that she expects inflation to improve gradually this year. â€œWe believe the bull market we are in isnâ€™t going to be derailed until either we go into recession or the Fed changes interest-rate policy from potential cuts to actual hikes,â€ said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. â€œExpect volatility between now and the end of the year, but donâ€™t expect the bull market to end without a change in the economy or Fed posture.â€ The S&amp;P 500 closed near 5,470. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.2%. Carnival Corp. surged almost 9% on a solid outlook. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.23%. Bitcoin topped $62,000. The loonie fluctuated as inflation unexpectedly surged in Canada, a setback for policymakers as they weigh further rate cuts next month. Investors are likely to keep piling into U.S. stocks at the sign of any pullback as the Fed edges closer to reducing interest rates, according to Societe Generale SA, which anticipates the easing cycle will begin in early 2025. Even after an about 15% rally year-to-date, strategists led by Manish Kabra expect the S&amp;P 500 to â€œstay in buy-the-dip mode, with the next upleg coming closer to a Fed rate-cutting cycle.â€ Nvidiaâ€™s recent sell-off isnâ€™t reflective of a worsening outlook for tech or the broader market, as other demand signals are positive, according to UBS. â€œNvidiaâ€™s correction shouldnâ€™t be mistaken as a warning signal on either the structural investment case for AI or the broader equity outlook,â€ wrote Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management To Neuberger Berman Groupâ€™s Steve Eisman, the chipmakerâ€™s three-day plunge is no more than a blip. The senior portfolio manager, best known for his short bet against subprime mortgages ahead of the global financial crisis, owns â€œa lotâ€ of the chipmakerâ€™s shares and considers it a long-term play thatâ€™s going to be relevant for years to come, he said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.

 26 Jul 2024 (Yonhap News Agency) SK hynix Inc. announced Friday a plan to invest 9.4 trillion won (US$6.8 billion) in building its first fab and relevant facilities at an envisioned semiconductor cluster in Yongin, south of Seoul.
The world's No. 2 memory chip maker said its board approved of the investment plan for the semiconductor cluster, which it aims to nurture into a key production base for artificial intelligence (AI) memory chips.
SK hynix plans to begin construction of the first chip plant in March next year and complete it by May 2027. It will also build three additional fabs in the 4.15 million-square-meter cluster.
"We will do our best to build the fab to cement the foundation for our company's future growth and to respond to surging AI chip demand in a timely manner," the company said.
The investment amount includes the cost of building the first chip plant, as well as business facilities, such as water treatment facilities, power facilities and offices, according to SK hynix.
SK hynix is a key HBM supplier to the U.S. AI chip giant Nvidia Corp., a major player in the AI semiconductor market with its graphics processing units.
SK hynix reported its highest quarterly profit in six years in the April-June period, fueled by solid sales of its premium memory chips used in AI computing.

Canadian-based mining companies that are betting on the global energy transition( https://financialpost.com/tag/energy-transition/ ) saw a surge of investor interest in 2023, according to the latest edition of the TSX Venture 50( https://financialpost.com/tag/tsx-venture/ ) list.
The annual ranking of top performers on Canada's main venture exchange, released by the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday, shows 2023 was a blockbuster year for the mining sector( https://financialpost.com/category/commodities/mining/ ).
Mining dominates this year's list, with companies in that sector posting an average 734 per cent market cap appreciation for the year and a 245 per cent average share price increase, the report said.
The gains came as investors flocked to small-cap and venture companies exploring opportunities in precious metals, critical minerals( https://financialpost.com/tag/critical-minerals/ ) and the energy transition, said Loui Anastasopoulos, CEO of the Toronto Stock Exchange, in an interview.
The TSX Venture 50 list showcases small-cap issuers across five sectors - energy, mining, clean technology and life sciences, diversified industries, and technology.
The companies are ranked by their 2022 performance in three areas - market capitalization growth, share price appreciation, and trading volume.
This year's companies delivered an average financial return of 121 per cent and saw an average market capitalization increase of 248 per cent, a boost from last year's performance. In December 2023, the total market cap of Venture 50 companies was $23.1 billion - an increase of $7.6 billion year-over-year.

Stock futures are slipping this morning after tech stocks pulled markets lower on Tuesday and investors await results from chipmaker Nvidia Corp.( https://financialpost.com/tag/nvidia-corp/ )

In a month when Nvidia Corp, briefly became the world's larg est company, hedge funds were "aggressively" selling tech stocks, according to analysis by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
This month's net selling in the United States tech sector is on track to be the largest on record going back in data since 2017, ac cording to Goldman's prime bro kerage data. Semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks
were the ones offloaded the most by hedge funds, followed by soft ware and internet stocks.
Nvidia shares have been chop py after losing US$430 billion in market value late last week. And June has been a volatile month for Big Tech stocks after the meteor ic rise of Nvidia, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. accounted for more than half of the 15 per cent advance in the S&;P 500 this year.
The trimming of exposure by hedge funds is in sharp contrast
to the record inflows seen into tech-related funds last week, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hit its latest record high on June 18. The weight of the tech sector in the S&;P 500 hit 33 per cent last week, the highest level in about 24 years.
What's more, the momentum factor-style investing that drove the likes of Nvidia to all-time highs this year is also faltering. Hedge funds' momentum expo sure is poised to decrease for the first time in six months, the Gold
man data showed.
"Long concentration" and "long crowdedness" have both seen no table declines and are at the low est levels this year, suggesting long-short fund managers have become more mindful of a po tential drawdown in those factors after strong returns.
Hedge funds are tilting more de fensively than usual. Their gross leverage has been declining, with North America and Europe by far the most notionally net sold re gions so far in June.
"After adding risk to their port folio in all but one week so far this year, trading flows from recent sessions point to some risk un winds, driven by long sales and to a lesser extent short covers," Goldman said in a note. Bloomberg !@COPYRIGHT=© 2024 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton)
