More than 100 attendees came to Case Western Reserve University on Feb. 26 in search of the future of polymer research.
The Polymer Initiative of Northeast Ohio (PINO) conference was held at CWRU in Cleveland. The annual event is organized by graduate students at the school's macromolecular science and engineering department.
The department, founded in 1963, was the first of its kind in the United States. Companies sponsoring the 2024 event included Owens Corning, Avient Corp., PPG, Bridgestone, Saint-Gobain, Sherwin-Williams Co., Parker Hannifin Corp. and Celanese Corp. Several of those firms are based in Ohio, which conference organizers said is home to almost 3,000 polymer-focused companies and almost $50 billion in annual polymer related shipments.
The conference also hosted a research poster contest and acted as an informal polymers job fair for students from CWRU and other colleges.
PINO Executive Director Hector Gomez Jimenez, a third-year doctoral student at CWRU, said doctoral candidates can benefit from researching companies they might want to work for.
"Take a look at their financial filings and how they present themselves," he added. "What are their leadership styles, communication skills and strengths? Is it a successful environment for engineers?"
PINO Logistics Director Mandy Zheng, a second year doctoral student at CWRU, said job candidates are looking for companies than can provide work-life balance and value the importance of mental health as a way to lower potential burnout.
Poster presentations at the event included a study of burst pressure performance on polystyrene/acrylic pipe and tubing by CWRU doctoral candidate Negar Shaghaghi. The product tested also has a 50 percent PS cap layer.
The pipe and tubing tested was made via multilayer coextrusion, which is a focus of research at CWRU. Shaghaghi said PS isn't the best material for the application tested, but it was used as a means to better measure burst pressure and improve future products.
Krishnaroop Chaudhuri of the University of Cincinnati presented on the penetration of contaminants into block copolymer coatings. His research, partly funded by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, showed that increased fluorination slows down penetration of water, dyes or other chemical agents.

Deb Janik Senior vice president of business development, Bedrock
A conversation with Deb Janik cycles back and forth from her love of Cleveland and its rich history to the shape of its future with the ease a 30-year career in public service and civic jobs brings.
Moreover, those steps led to her current role at Bedrock's Cleveland office. As senior vice president of business development, she is part of Cavs owner Dan Gilbert's team to revitalize the Cuyahoga River on the barren, cliff-like valley on the Huron Road side of the Terminal Tower complex. Bedrock has a key part of the Bibb administration's Shore-to-Core-to-Shore plan to revitalize the lakefront, the riverfront and the city in between because of its vast holdings and scale as a major Cleveland realty developer.
"I'm just part of a well-oiled machine," Janik said.
Yvette Ittu, president and CEO of the Cleveland Development Advisors and former colleague at the Greater Cleveland Partnership, said, "Deb has a talent for taking complex pieces of a puzzle and fitting them together in a way that helps drive major initiatives, like the Riverfront Development project."
Most recently, Janik served as senior vice president for business growth and development services at GCP. Previous roles included chief of staff and chief development officer for former Cleveland Mayor Jane Campbell and positions at Neighborhood Progress Inc., KeyBank and the Cuyahoga County Port Authority.
"It all started with the Cleveland Sinking Fund Division," Janik said. She landed a staff job in the unit of the city's finance department at the Voinovich administration in the late 1980s.
At the time, the city was working its way out of default. That meant she dealt often with bond lawyers at top law firms and Wall Streeters as the city worked its way back into the bond market. She went on to work for two more Cleveland mayors.
"Mayor Michael White showed me what it was he loved most about Cleveland: the people," Janik said. At GCP she worked with CEOs from companies like Eaton and Sherwin- Williams Co. and absorbed how they approach leadership, especially from Beth Mooney, retired chairman and CEO of KeyBank.
Janik said she is mindful that in her career, she "benefited from the women who preceded me," and she broke open business leadership roles for women.
Today, Janik is on the private side of the table. However, she notes she considers Bedrock efforts with government and civic types more like "working at a round table."
The Broadview Heights native and her family now live in Rocky River. However, she's eagerly awaiting a chance to move downtown after her daughter, 16, goes to college.
Janik's dedication to Cleveland is rivaled only by her dedication to serving as a mentor to young people.
Janik prizes a meeting with the late George Voinovich as he ended his run as governor.
"He said to me, 'This is one of my kids,' " she recalled, a product of the late U.S. senator's efforts to prepare talented young people for public service. Today, she said, "I'm thrilled when I see someone I helped along the way thriving and contributing."

Latest plan for riverfront hints at future development

The latest version of the comprehensive plan Bedrock Cleveland and the City of Cleveland's planners are working up for the riverfront behind Tower City entails transforming Huron and Canal Roads and a new platform for future development.
Struck from the original master development plan was a proposal to extend Tower City Center near its barrel-vaulted top by closing West Huron Road. Nora Romanoff, Bedrock vice president of business development, told Crain's that the idea was scrapped because of what would be a "catastrophic" impact on downtown traffic in the area.
How Tower City will connect to the riverfront is a key part of the city's shore-to-core-to-shore plan, she said, remains to be worked out.
But, she added, "Bedrock remains committed to its proposed vision for the Cuyahoga Riverfront Master Plan. We are going through the process to determine how Tower City Center will connect to the riverfront, creating access from shore-to-core-to-shore."
Updated drawings shared with the Cleveland City Planning Commission on Friday, July 12, also show that a new, so-far unnamed riverfront road would be created about 200 feet closer to the river than the existing Canal Road.
Currently, Canal Road is so far back from the river there is little sense of a riverfront drive when passing over it, Romanoff said in the interview.
Meantime, Canal Road, which has played a big part of Northeast Ohio's economic development, would get a new role in Bedrock's future plans.
The current plan calls for a two-level platform for future commercial development closest to Tower City on the river valley's rim. One level of buildings would meet Huron Road at the precipice for their front doors and another would face the proposed riverfront road.
Meantime, Canal Road would be converted to an underground service road connecting the two levels. That would reduce conflicts between delivery vehicles needed for the potential towers and the public's ability to enjoy the slope.
A series of about a dozen buildings would pepper the area, according to a massing study of the area.
"These are massing studies which show what could be possible," Romanoff emphasized, and are not scoped out yet by Bedrock planners as to their sizes.
Intact in the plan is the central concept of converting parking lots currently being used by Sherwin- Williams Co. to public green space (Bedrock now owns those lots). The riverfront walking path key to the plan would be some 3,000 linear feet long.
Verbiage proposed by city planners and Bedrock says the proposed buildings should be designed in such a way their ground level would activate their surroundings with retail or other features.
Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad extension
The other big addition to the plan is Bedrock's proposal for a depot for the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, finally allowing the popular railroad to reach downtown from its current northern end in Independence.
A proposed downtown connection for the nonprofit's moving historic trains has been sought for decades. It is currently under study in an effort led by the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency, which coordinates federally funded infrastructure efforts and regional initiatives.
The proposed site would be on the south side of Hope Memorial Bridge where existing railroad tracks - which the line could use - now end.
Romanoff told Crain's that Bedrock added the potential site because Kofi Bonner, Bedrock CEO, said the company should contribute to existing planning for a downtown depot by suggesting a site.
The advantage of the location south of the bridge near West Third Street, she said, is that it's near a proposed riverfront access area and kayak launch in the plan. Those stretches are currently all bulkheaded, and Bedrock is updating sections of it as part of nearby plans for the proposed Cleveland Clinic Global Peak Performance Center, which incorporates a downtown practice facility for the Cavaliers.
Comprehensive plans, often called master plans, such as the one Bedrock and the city are developing, stand to shape public infrastructure improvements and Bedrock's property development over the decades.
City planners on July 12 reviewed the plan in depth but did not vote on it because a final plan is expected later in the year.
When asked about the location of the proposed downtown railroad depot by Bedrock on July 12, Joe Mazur, president and CEO of the Cuyahoga Railway, said it was the first he had heard of the proposal.
He declined to comment, noting that NOACA is leading the planning initiative.
Instead of dead-ending Huron between Ontario Street and Superior Avenue, the plan calls for the street to be reduced in size with fewer traffic lanes, the addition of bike lanes, and public spaces, similar to other road diet plans in the region.
Romanoff said that would soften that section of Huron and improve the diversity of forms of transportation in the plan.

The issue in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. County of Monterey, Calif. was whether California Public Resources Code § 3106 preempts a November 2016 ballot initiative/county ordinance entitled "Protect Our Water: Ban Fracking and Limit Risky Oil Operations Initiative" (Measure Z). Measure Z, which passed with 56% of the vote, banned fracking,[1] oil and gas wastewater injection and/or impoundment, and the drilling of new oil and gas wells throughout Monterey County's unincorporated areas.[2] The California Supreme Court ruled that state law preempts Measure Z. 
On December 14, 2016, plaintiffs Chevron, U.S.A. and other energy producers filed writ of mandate petitions, complaints for declaratory and injunctive relief, and inverse condemnation against the defendants in Monterey County Superior Court. The plaintiffs won at a bench trial, and the court issued a writ of mandate directing Monterey County to invalidate Measure Z. The California Court of Appeal affirmed.[3] The California Supreme Court affirmed.[4]
The court noted that although Article XI, § 7 of the California Constitution gives counties and cities the power to make and enforce "local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws,"[5] prior California Supreme Court opinions held that "[i]f otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law, it is preempted by such law and is void."[6] 
The court found that § 3106 gives "well operators the authority to use all methods and practices the [Geologic Energy Management Division] supervisor has approved, including specifically, the water and steam injections methods that Measure Z bans."[7] The court stated that because Measure Z disallowed certain oil production methods, it nullified and thus contradicted § 3106's mandate "that the state 'shall' supervise oil operation in a way that permits well operators to 'utilize all methods and practices' the supervisor has approved."[8]  
The court further stated that
In other words, whereas section 3106 directs the supervisor to make decisions about the use of all oil production methods-inclusive of those methods Measure Z identifies-Measure Z authorizes the County to make decisions regarding some of those methods. Thus, were any oil producer to ask the state to decide whether those methods are authorized for use in the County, Measure Z, by banning those methods, has made that decision for-and in lieu of-the supervisor; it has, in all cases, usurped the supervisor's statutorily granted authority to decide whether those methods are "suitable . . . in each proposed case."[9]
The court noted that it stated in Calif. Fed. Savings & Loan Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles that a conflict is "a genuine one" where it is "unresolvable short of choosing between one enactment and the other."[10] Here, a "genuine conflict" existed because § 3106 and Measure Z conflicted regarding whether the state or county controlled the permissibility and use of certain oil and natural gas extraction methods. Accordingly, the court found that "the local ordinance must yield to the supreme state law."[11]
Section 3106 explicitly provides that it is the State of California's oil and gas supervisor who has the authority to decide whether to permit an oil and gas drilling operation to drill a new well or to utilize wastewater injection in its operations. Section 3106 commits these operational aspects of oil drilling operations to the state's discretion, not that of localities, and thus § 3106 preempts local regulation.
The court dismissed the county's argument that "several statutes that allow local control over some aspects of oil extraction reflect the Legislature's [purported] intent not to preempt local oil-related ordinances."[12] The court stated that local entities have the authority to determine "whether and where oil production may occur within their boundaries based on local zoning laws; [but] they do not address oil production methods at existing wells."[13] Therefore, restricting "the location at which oil may be extracted-a proper concern of [local] zoning measures"[14]-is different and inapplicable to the question of whether "a local ordinance that regulates certain methods and practices of oil extraction in areas where oil production has already been approved and is ongoing."[15]
Similarly, the court distinguished its opinion from Big Creek Lumber Co. v. County of Santa Cruz, Cal.,[16] stating that Measure Z did not address "where" local operations could take place, but "how" oil producers and well operators should be permitted to extract oil-the same subject matter covered by § 3106. The court stated that Measure Z, "by its plain language,"[17] banned "oil production methods, i.e., activities in support of 'oil and gas wastewater injection or oil and gas wastewater impoundment'" rather than imposing "a locational restriction."[18]
The court affirmed the trial and appellate courts' rejections of the appellants'
characterization of Measure Z as a "land use" ordinance entitled to a strong presumption against preemption, stating that the measure's "prohibition on certain 'land uses' is clearly a pretextual attempt to do indirectly what [the County] cannot do directly," i.e., ban certain methods of oil production in a way that will bring oil production in the County "to a complete halt in five years or less."[19]
 As the court stated in Great Western Shows, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles, Cal., "when a [state] statute or statutory scheme seeks to promote a certain activity and, at the same time, permits more stringent local regulation of that activity, local regulation cannot be used to completely ban the activity or otherwise frustrate the statute's purpose."[20]
The court stated that it did not need to reach the questions of whether the doctrines of field preemption and/or federal obstacle preemption applied,[21] or whether the federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974[22] preempted Measure Z, because it found that California state law did.
In sum, the court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. held that a local entity may not use its traditional zoning and land use powers to nullify, contradict, or otherwise frustrate a state statute's purpose or as a pretextual attempt to do indirectly what state law does not permit it to do directly.
