Over the decades since Walt Disney opened his first theme park in 1955, the company's tourism business has ballooned to an enterprise worth tens of billions in yearly sales, with sprawling locations in Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Today, the entertainment giant is doubling down once again. The Walt Disney Co. plans to invest $60 billion over 10 years into its so-called experiences division, which includes the theme parks, resorts and cruise line, as well as merchandise.
In Anaheim, the City Council recently approved an expansion plan at Disneyland Resort, which could lead to at least $1.9 billion of development and involve new attractions alongside hotel, retail and restaurant space.
Why the massive investment? At a time when Disney faces revenue challenges due to cord cutting, streaming wars and a slower film box office, its theme parks are a bright - and reliable - spot for its business. Moreover, they play a major part in the company's strategy - using well-loved movies to inspire rides and vice versa (think "Pirates of the Caribbean"), feeding an ongoing virtuous cycle.
"When you consider other elements of Disney's business, those theme parks, they've shown themselves to be proven winners," said Carissa Baker, assistant professor of theme park and attraction management at the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management. "There's no doubt that they have stayed very competitive in the film space and the TV space, but they've always led the theme park sector."
During the most recent fiscal year, the company's experiences division - which is heavily anchored by the parks - brought in about 70% of Disney's operating income, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. By contrast, Disney's sports sector, including ESPN, contributed 19% of operating income. The entertainment division, consisting of the company's TV channels, streaming services and movie studios, brought up the rear at 11%.
Those numbers represent a stark contrast from even 10 years ago, when the company was heavily reliant on its TV networks, which brought in 56% of Disney's operating income (that segment included ESPN at the time). The parks and resorts division drew just 20%.
The tide began to turn in 2019, as the global theme park industry saw record-breaking attendance, just in time for the pandemic to hit the next year.
With the parks closed, Disney reported an operating loss of $81 million in 2020. Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure, in particular, were shut for 15 months, due to tight restrictions in the Golden State. Since then, pent-up demand from visitors has propelled theme park revenue in a way that hasn't been replicated in movie theaters.
"The industry was really growing quickly before COVID-19, and that obviously put a crimp on everything," said Martin Lewison, associate professor of business management at Farmingdale State College in New York. "But it appears as long as the economy remains healthy, the industry is back on track for that growth."
Have to be there
Theme parks are typically one of the fastest parts of the travel and hospitality industry to recover after economic downturns, said Dennis Speigel, founder and chief executive of consulting firm International Theme Park Services. Part of that is because it's hard to duplicate the theme park experience at home.
"Disney sets the bar for our entire global theme park industry," Speigel said. "The guests, the visitors, they love the way Disney immerses you in their storytelling."
The Disneyland Resort expansion plan, known as DisneylandForward, will help the 490-acre park stay fresh for visitors. The plan calls for changes to the park's zoning, allowing the company more freedom to mix attractions, theme parks, shopping, dining and parking. While the plan doesn't specify exactly which attractions will be added to the resort, company officials have floated ideas including immersive Frozen, Tron and Avatar experiences.
Over the years, Disneyland has cycled out many rides and exhibits to make way for new ones - for example, of the original 33 attractions that debuted with the park, only about a dozen still exist. (One that didn't make it? The Monsanto Hall of Chemistry).
Repeat visits
Though Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure have recently seen additions such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus and the renovated Pixar Place Hotel, giving guests new reasons to come back again and again are the key to increased growth. This summer, the Magic Kingdom will open Tiana's Bayou Adventure, replacing the controversial "Song of the South"-inspired Splash Mountain attraction.
"People love riding Haunted Mansion 50 times, but the truth is that even that gets old. So new rides, new lands, new parks - these things draw in attendance, they create pricing power and they add capacity," said Lewison of Farmingdale State College.
And Disney's rivals show no signs of slowing down, meaning Disney can't just rely on its existing hits. Universal Studios Hollywood recently added Super Nintendo World to its park, SeaWorld is touting new attractions and shows for its 60th anniversary this year, and even immersive art installation company Meow Wolf is expanding throughout the U.S.

Disney's streaming business turns profitable in first financial report since challenge to Iger; The Walt Disney Co. moved to a loss in its second quarter, hampered by significantly higher restructuring and impairment charges, but its adjusted profit topped Wall Street's view and its streaming business was profitable

The Walt Disney Co. moved to a loss in its second quarter, hampered by restructuring and impairment charges, but its adjusted profit topped expectations and its streaming business turned a profit. Theme parks also continued to do well.
While Disney said Tuesday that it foresees its streaming business softening in the current quarter due to its streaming service in India, Disney+Hotstar, it expects its combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and to be a meaningful future growth driver for the company, with further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025. 
Disney+ core subscribers climbed by more than 6% in the second quarter. 
Revenue at Disney's domestic theme parks rose 7%, while its theme parks overseas reported a 29% increase. 
"Looking at our company as a whole, it's clear that the turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results," CEO Bob Iger said in a prepared statement. 
It's the first financial report since shareholders rebuffed efforts by activist investor Nelson Peltz to claim seats on the company board last month, standing firmly behind Iger. 
For the period ended March 30, Disney lost $20 million, or a penny per share. That compares with a profit of $1.27 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year ago. 
Restructuring and impairment charges surged to $2.05 billion from $152 million in the prior-year period. 
Adjusted earnings were $1.21 per share, easily beating the $1.12 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted. 
The Burbank, California, company's revenue rose to $22.08 billion from $21.82 billion a year earlier. However, this was below Wall Street's estimate of $22.13 billion. 
Shares slipped 2% before the market open. 
In February The Walt Disney Co. said that it was making "significant cost reductions" and reduced its selling, general and other operations expenses by $500 million in its first quarter. The company cut thousands of jobs in 2023. 
In March allies of Gov. Ron DeSantis and Disney reached a settlement agreement in a state court fight over how Walt Disney World is developed in the future following the takeover of the theme park resort's government by the Florida governor. 
Last month character performers at Disneyland in California and the union organizing them, Actors' Equity Association, said they had filed a petition for union recognition.

Disney's streaming business turns a profit in first financial report since challenge to Iger; The Walt Disney Co. moved to a loss in its second quarter, hampered by significantly higher restructuring and impairment charges, but its adjusted profit topped Wall Street's view and its streaming business was profitable

The Walt Disney Co. swung to a loss in its second quarter because of restructuring and impairment charges, but its adjusted profit topped expectations and its streaming business turned a profit. Theme parks also continued to do well and the company boosted its outlook for the year.
While Disney said Tuesday that it foresees its overall streaming business softening in the current quarter due to its platform in India, Disney+Hotstar, it expects its combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and to be a meaningful future growth driver for the company, with further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025. 
The direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posted quarterly operating income of $47 million compared with a loss of $587 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 13% to $5.64 billion. 
For the combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, second-quarter operating loss shrunk to $18 million from $659 million, while revenue improved to $6.19 billion from $5.51 billion. 
Disney+ core subscribers climbed by more than 6% in the second quarter. 
Yet the improved picture for Disney on streaming arrives with its cable business in decline. That segment saw revenue slide 8% in the most recent quarter. 
"Looking at our company as a whole, it's clear that the turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results," CEO Bob Iger said in a prepared statement. 
Speaking during Disney's conference call, Iger said that the company plans to add an ESPN tab to Disney+ by the end of the year, a maneuver that was previously made with Hulu. This will give U.S. subscribers access to some live sports and studio programming within the Disney+ app. 
ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery announced plans in February to launch a sports streaming platform in the fall that will include offerings from at least 15 networks and all four major professional sports leagues. 
Iger also said that next month the company will start cracking down on password sharing for its streaming service in some markets, and will expand that crackdown globally in September. 
While Disney has quality streaming content, Iger said that the company must now focus on building out its technology, similar to what rivals like Netflix have been doing. Those actions, including the password crackdown, are expected to improve profits. 
It's the first financial report since shareholders rebuffed efforts by activist investor Nelson Peltz to claim seats on the company board last month, standing firmly behind Iger as he tries to energize the company after a rough stretch. 
Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said that some Disney investors may have been expecting more from the quarterly report, but that "the company has tilted its operation back to its core business model, which is more conservative by nature." 
Monteiro was focused on the company's efforts to turn its streaming division profitable. 
"The big surprise of the day came on the streaming front, which finally managed to bring profits - way ahead of predictions - amid Hollywood's massive strike period," Monteiro said. "This indicates that perhaps the more global, low-production-cost Netflix-like model is probably the way to go in an operation that needs to rethink its growth expectations as a whole." 
Revenue at Disney's domestic theme parks rose 7%, while its theme parks overseas reported a 29% increase. 
But Disney acknowledged wrestling with higher costs at its theme parks during the quarter due to inflation. 
The company said that there was increased spending by guests at Walt Disney World due to higher ticket prices, while Disneyland guests boosted their spending due to an increase in ticket prices and hotel room rates. 
Overseas, Hong Kong Disneyland benefited from the opening of World of Frozen, a section of the park that includes rides based on the popular "Frozen" movies, in November. 
Similar to many tourist destinations, Disney is continuing to adjust to post-pandemic travel. 
"While consumers continue to travel in record numbers, and we are still seeing healthy demand, we are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post Covid travel," Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said during the call. 
For the period ended March 30, Disney lost $20 million, or a penny per share. That compares with a profit of $1.27 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year ago. 
Restructuring and impairment charges surged to $2.05 billion from $152 million in the prior-year period. 
Adjusted earnings, which stripped out the charges and other items, were $1.21 per share, easily beating the $1.12 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted. 
Disney said that due to its second-quarter performance, it now has a full-year adjusted earnings per share growth target of 25%. It previously predicted growth of at least 20%. 
The Burbank, California, company's revenue rose to $22.08 billion from $21.82 billion a year earlier, but was slightly lower than Wall Street estimates of $22.13 billion. 
Content sales and licensing revenue tumbled 40% because Disney didn't release any significant movie titles during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year period, which included the release of "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania." The year-ago results were also helped by the ongoing performance of "Avatar: The Way of Water," which was released in December 2022. 
Shares fell more than 10% Tuesday. 
In February The Walt Disney Co. said that it was making "significant cost reductions" and reduced its selling, general and other operations expenses by $500 million in its first quarter. The company cut thousands of jobs in 2023. 
In March allies of Gov. Ron DeSantis and Disney reached a settlement agreement in a state court fight over how Walt Disney World is developed in the future following the takeover of the theme park resort's government by the Florida governor.

Hyundai sent actors John Stamos and Josh Peck on a road trip to celebrate the history of Walt Disney Co. and promote the Ioniq 5.
A series of videos posted on Disney's YouTube channel last week documents the duo's journey to locations around Southern California in a Disney100 Platinum Edition of the Hyundai electric vehicle.
The first episode shows Stamos marveling at "hidden Mickeys" on the car's wheels after he and Peck ride Walt Disney's one-eighth-scale model train at Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum. In the second video, Peck talks up the car's 260-mile driving range to a security guard at Disney's studios in Burbank and creates a jingle rhyming "Hyundai" with "bro day."
The videos are one piece of Hyundai's partnership with Walt Disney Co. in connection with Disney's 100th anniversary. Hyundai is building 1,000 copies of the Disney edition Ioniq 5, which starts at $60,775 with shipping and was developed with creative input from Walt Disney Imagineering.
"From all-new ads featuring iconic Disney movie scenes to the introduction of a vehicle with visual creative input from Walt Disney Imagineering, together our brands illustrated there can be magic in every journey," Hyundai Motor America CMO Angela Zepeda said in a statement. "We look forward to further collaboration with the beloved Disney brand through our shared commitment to inspiring joy and innovation."

Disney reaches agreement with ValueAct, secures its support for company's board nominees; Disney has a new ally in activist investor ValueAct Capital Management, garnering its support for the company's board nominees as it continues to wage a proxy battle with Nelson Peltz

Disney has a new ally in activist investor ValueAct Capital Management, garnering its support for the company's board nominees as it continues to wage a proxy battle with Nelson Peltz.
The Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday that the confidentiality agreement with ValueAct will allow the company to provide information to ValueAct and consult with it on strategic matters, including through meetings with its board and management. 
"ValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its Co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we've had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders," Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. 
Last month Nelson Peltz's investment management firm Trian Fund Management said that it was planning to nominate the activist investor and a former chief financial officer of Disney for seats on the media and entertainment company's board. 
Along with Peltz, Trian is planning to nominate James Rasulo, who served as Disney's CFO from 2010 to 2015. Prior to serving as CFO, Rasulo was chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide from 2005 to 2009 and was president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts from 2002 to 2005. 
Trian, which owns $3 billion of common stock in Disney, is looking to nominate Peltz and Rasulo to the Disney board at the company's 2024 annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to be held in the spring. 
Disney previously said that Trian has provided notice that it plans to nominate two individuals for its board. The Burbank, California-based company has said that its governance and nominating committee, which evaluates director nominations, will review the proposed Trian nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process. 
Peltz's proxy battle with Disney has spanned nearly a year. In January Peltz sought to join Disney's board, claiming that the company was struggling with self-inflicted problems. At the time, Disney urged shareholders to vote against Peltz and named current board member Mark Parker as its chairman. Parker, who also serves as executive chairman at Nike Inc., succeeded Susan Arnold, who didn't stand for re-election due to Disney's 15-year term limit requirements. 
By February Peltz ended his push for a Disney board seat, one day after CEO Bob Iger announced a major restructuring of the company that included thousands of job cuts. 
However, in November Trian decided to resurrect its proxy battle. Disney put out a statement at the time defending the company and its board. 
Peltz has previously waged successful proxy battles at blue chip companies including DuPont and Procter & Gamble. 
Disney continues to show support for its existing board. ValueAct confirmed it will support Disney's slate of board nominees. 
In early trading, the stock dipped 40 cents to $90.31.

New Delhi, May 7 -- Walt Disney Co. shares tumbled more than 9 per cent on Tuesday morning in New York after the media giant announced its quarterly financial results and forecasts for the current quarter.
At 11:48 a.m. EDT, the Walt Disney stock was at $104.90, lower 9.93 per cent.
The direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney and Hulu, posted quarterly operating income of $47 million compared with a loss of $587 million a year earlier.
Revenue rose 13 per cent to $5.64 billion.
For the combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney , Hulu and ESPN , second-quarter operating loss shrunk to $18 million from $659 million, while revenue improved to $6.19 billion from $5.51 billion.
The company added more than 6 million subscribers in the second quarter to its Disney streaming platform.
"Looking at our company as a whole, it's clear that the turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results," Walt Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger said in a statement.
Walt Disney chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said the company doesn't expect to see core Disney subscriber growth in the current quarter and profitability in streaming will suffer due to additional expenses for cricket rights in India.
"We are pleased with the progress we're making in streaming, although, as we said before, the path to long-term profitability is not a linear one," Johnston said.
The company said ittook an impairment charge of about $2 billion in the second quarter related to the India deal and to its traditional television networks.
It expects its entire streaming business to be profitable in the fourth quarter.
The company is planning to add an ESPN tab to Disney by the end of the year.
Disney's theme parks registered revenue growth of 10 per cent in the second quarter and the segment posted a 12 per cent gain in operating income also.

BUSINESS; What feud? Florida board OKs Disney expansion; DeSantis appointees praise the Burbank entertainment giant's decades-long proposal for its Orlando resort.

A special Florida district that governs Walt Disney World Resort has voted unanimously to approve the company's plans for expansion, officially ending the years-long feud between the House of Mouse and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District voted Wednesday in favor of Walt Disney Co.'s proposal to expand its theme park complex in Orlando, including an $8-billion investment during the first 10 years and up to $17 billion over the next 10 to 20 years.
The expansion is part of a major investment spree by the Burbank media and entertainment giant into its so-called experiences division, which is largely made up of its theme park empire around the world. Disneyland Resort in Anaheim is expected to expand as well, with an investment of at least $1.9 billion.
At Wednesday's meeting, local tourism executives and board members alike praised the benefits of the proposal and its potential economic effect on the state.
"Walt Disney World is inextricably intertwined in the fabric of the state of Florida, and the success of Walt Disney World is the success of Central Florida," board member Brian Aungst Jr. said during the meeting. "I was always extremely optimistic and knew that we would get here because it's the right outcome."
The path to Wednesday's approval was long and winding. The controversy began in 2022 when Disney -- Florida's largest private employer -- voiced opposition to DeSantis' so-called "Don't Say Gay" legislation, which banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in local schools.
DeSantis then took control of what was known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a quasi-municipal government that controlled the land Walt Disney World sat on but was run for years by officials essentially selected by Disney. DeSantis renamed the governing body the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and appointed his allies as members.
Dueling lawsuits ensued, including a 1st Amendment case Disney filed against the state and the governor, which was eventually tossed.
Tensions started to ease in March after Disney and the state of Florida reached a settlement of a separate state lawsuit, a move that came a few months after DeSantis ended his presidential bid.
DeSantis had made Disney a high-profile culture war punching bag even before his doomed campaign began.
After Wednesday's vote, Walt Disney World Resort President Jeff Vahle cheered the outcome, saying in a statement that the new development agreement "paves the way for us to invest billions of dollars in Walt Disney World Resort, supporting the growth of this global destination, fueling the Florida economy, and allowing us to deliver even more memorable and extraordinary experiences for our guests."

BUSINESS; Disneyland workers ratify pact, avoid strike; Anaheim resort employees will see pay increases and a higher minimum wage in the three-year deal.

Harmony has been restored to the "happiest place on Earth."
Thousands of workers at Disneyland voted Monday to ratify a deal that averted what could have been the first strike at the Anaheim theme park in 40 years. Employees at Disney California Adventure, Downtown Disney and the Disneyland Resort hotels also approved new contracts with the company. The union bargaining committee did not disclose the ratification vote totals.
"By ratifying these contracts, Disney cast members have secured historic raises and policies and protections that reflect their role as magic makers in the Disney parks," the union bargaining committee said in a statement.
"For months hard-working cast members have stood together at the bargaining table and in the parks to ensure Disney recognized what they bring to the theme park experience, and these contracts are a concrete and direct result of this tireless work."
The Master Services Council, an alliance of labor unions representing some 14,000 Disneyland Resort employees, and Walt Disney Co. reached tentative deals July 24 -- just days after Disneyland workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.
According to the Master Services Council, the three-year agreements contain pay increases amounting to $6.10 an hour over the life of the contract, a higher minimum wage of $24 an hour in 2024, additional compensation bumps for senior employees and a more flexible attendance policy for custodians, ride operators, candy makers, merchandise clerks and other workers who keep Disneyland running.
"We are pleased that our cast members approved the new agreements, which, along with all we offer as part of our employment experience, demonstrate how much we value them and our profound commitment to their overall well-being," Disneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good said in a statement.
Earlier this month, the Master Services Council scheduled a strike authorization vote -- which gives union leaders the option to call a walkout if a deal can't be reached -- after filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. The group accused Disney of threatening to discipline hundreds of resort employees for wearing union buttons to work.
The unions maintain that wearing the buttons depicting Mickey Mouse's raised fist is a protected form of collective action by workers, while the company says the pins violate the staff dress code. Disney has said that only "a handful" of repeat incidents led to disciplinary action, starting with a verbal warning.
The buttons functioned as a symbol of solidarity among Disneyland Resort staffers, who had been bargaining for new contracts with Walt Disney Co. since late April.
The old Disneyland employee contract ended June 16, while the Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney agreements were set to expire Sept. 30.
"Together by wearing buttons, attending rallies and telling their stories to the public, cast members fought for a more promising future for themselves, their fellow cast members, and their families," the union bargaining committee said in a statement.
"These contracts are historic for Disney cast members and we're pleased cast members' lives will improve as a result."

Disney's streaming business turns a profit, tops expectations

The Walt Disney Co. swung to a loss in its second quarter because of restructuring and impairment charges, but its adjusted profit topped expectations and its streaming business turned a profit. Theme parks also continued to do well and the company boosted its outlook for the year.
While Disney said yesterday that it foresees its overall streaming business softening in the current quarter due to its platform in India, Disney+Hotstar, it expects its combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and to be a meaningful future growth driver for the company, with further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025.
The direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, posted quarterly operating income of $47 million compared with a loss of $587 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 13% to $5.64 billion.
Disney+ core subscribers climbed by more than 6% in the second quarter.
"Looking at our company as a whole, it's clear that the turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results," CEO Bob Iger said in a prepared statement.
It's the first financial report since shareholders rebuffed efforts by activist investor Nelson Peltz to claim seats on the company board last month, standing firmly behind Iger as he tries to energize the company after a rough stretch.
Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said that some Disney investors may have been expecting more from the quarterly report, but that "the company has tilted its operation back to its core business model, which is more conservative by nature."
Monteiro was focused on the company's efforts to turn its streaming division profitable.
"The big surprise of the day came on the streaming front, which finally managed to bring profits - way ahead of predictions - amid Hollywood's massive strike period," Monteiro said. "This indicates that perhaps the more global, low-production-cost Netflix-like model is probably the way to go in an operation that needs to rethink its growth expectations as a whole."
Revenue at Disney's domestic theme parks rose 7%, while its theme parks overseas reported a 29% increase.
But Disney acknowledged wrestling with higher costs at its theme parks during the quarter due to inflation.
The company said that there was increased spending by guests at Walt Disney World due to higher ticket prices, while Disneyland guests boosted their spending due to an increase in ticket prices and hotel room rates.
Overseas, Hong Kong Disneyland benefited from the opening of World of Frozen, a section of the park that includes rides based on the popular "Frozen" movies, in November.
For the period ended March 30, Disney lost $20 million, or a penny per share. That compares with a profit of $1.27 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year ago.
Restructuring and impairment charges surged to $2.05 billion from $152 million in the prior-year period.
Adjusted earnings, which stripped out the charges and other items, were $1.21 per share, easily beating the $1.12 per share that analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Disney said that due to its second-quarter performance, it now has a full-year adjusted earnings per share growth target of 25%. It previously predicted growth of at least 20%.
The Burbank, California, company's revenue rose to $22.08 billion from $21.82 billion a year earlier, but was slightly lower than Wall Street estimates of $22.13 billion.
Content sales and licensing revenue tumbled 40% because Disney didn't release any significant movie titles during the second quarter as compared with the prior-year period, which included the release of "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania." The year-ago results were also helped by the ongoing performance of "Avatar: The Way of Water," which was released in December 2022.
Shares dropped 5% before the market open.
In February The Walt Disney Co. said that it was making "significant cost reductions" and reduced its selling, general and other operations expenses by $500 million in its first quarter. The company cut thousands of jobs in 2023.
In March allies of Gov. Ron DeSantis and Disney reached a settlement agreement in a state court fight over how Walt Disney World is developed in the future following the takeover of the theme park resort's government by the Florida governor.
Last month character performers at Disneyland in California and the union organizing them, Actors' Equity Association, said they had filed a petition for union recognition. MICHELLE CHAPMAN,MDT/AP
